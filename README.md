# Automated-hadwritten-answersheet-grading-tool
Developing an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for handwritten text recognition. Aimed to do automated handwritten answer sheet grading tool using mainly computer vision, neural networks and machine learning. Given a dataset of handwritten sentences, the goal is to build a deep learning model capable of accurately transcribing the handwritten text into machine-readable text. Succeeding this we use the dataset we created of various statements written by multiple people to verify the model and evaluate them based on correctness using various similarity methods
